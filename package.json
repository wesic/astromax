  "description": "- @astrojs/tailwind - https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/ - @astrojs/sitemap - https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/ ## Template Structure Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files: ``` / ├── public/ ├── src/ │   └── pages/ │       └── index.astro └── package.json ``` Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.",
